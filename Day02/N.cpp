// Notes :
//
//
// 1 and t divides t
// so u are looking for one more divider
// let x be this divider
// so t = x * (t / x) since there is only one more
// x has to be (t/x) so  x = t/x =>  t = x^2
// and x has to be prime so that it itself doesn't have more dividers
//
// the conditions are then  x = sqrt(t) has to be Perfect square and Prime !
